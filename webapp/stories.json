    "text": "<p>
    Graduation day at Rutgers University is a chance for students to relax after four years of college and celebrate with family and friends before entering the real world.
Or, when Bill Nye is the keynote speaker, it's a reminder that the amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere is rising and its future may be a "no-way-out overheated globe."
Nye, the bow-tied host of 'Bill Nye The Science Guy,' used his speech at Rutgers' commencement Sunday as a platform to tell students they must find a way to stop climate change.</p>
<p>Though it wasn't the message some graduates were expecting, several said they were happy to get another lesson from the scientist they grew up watching.</p>

The Democrat, who is running to replace California's retiring Sen. Barabara Boxer, would otherwise seem like a paragon of diversity. But when she let out a stereotypical Native American 'war cry' over the weekend, it marred that image and sent her running.

Literally -- away from a reporter trying to chase her down for comment on the gaffe that many found racially offensive. But late Sunday, she spoke about the slip-up.</p>

<p>Native Americans know she's watching out for them, she told CNN affiliate KTLA. 'And they know what many of you don't know — that like so many Mexican Americans, I am proudly Native American on my mother's side,' Sanchez said.</p>"

    "<p>JERUSALEM — Umm Nidal peered over her balcony in Jerusalem’s walled Old City on Sunday, watching thousands of marchers waving Israeli flags stream through an alleyway as they celebrated Israel’s unification of the city in the 1967 war.
A teenager looked up and made an obscene gesture at Umm Nidal and her children, who were standing on the balcony with her. Minutes later, another youth hurled trash at them.
'When you look at them, it makes them angry,' she explained.</p>
<p>
The decades-old Jerusalem Day march has taken on a polarizing and nationalistic tone in recent years, with marchers attacking Palestinians in the cramped Arab quarter here and clashes erupting between Jewish and Palestinian youths, particularly near the Damascus Gate.</p>"
