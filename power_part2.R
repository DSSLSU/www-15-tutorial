# Q1: Describe the data.
# Q2: What does the effect of receiving a gift appear to be?
# Q3: What are the reasons you might see this relationship?
# Q4: What are possible experiments you could run to identify
#     the effect of receiving a gift on giving a gift?
# Q5: Do a power analysis to determine how many subjects
#     would have to be in your experiment with more reasonable
#     effect sizes. (hint: simulate some effect size and see
#     how often you are able to detect it, via simulation)
