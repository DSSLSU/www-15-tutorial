ICWSM 2014 Tutorial
=================

### Summary

### Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of statistics and probability theory, and some familiarity with programming.  We will be using R to do exercises involving power calculations and data analysis, so we recommend that attendees either have experience with R or come with a buddy who knows R.

### Outcomes:
- Understand the strengths and limitations of observational and experimental research.

- Learn how to do power calculations via simulation to plan experiments in R.

- Learn how to implement experiments using Python and PlanOut, an open-source toolkit for online experimentation.

- Learn about common pitfalls and best practices for deploying, logging, and analyzing experiments.

- Learn how to integrate experimentation into Web applications, and analyze the results using R.

### Justification
Software requirements: git, R, Python, PlanOut (to be available on github), Flask (available on github), sample R and python code (to be available on github).

Other requirements: a projector, Internet access, microphone, paper printouts (we will provide the latter).

## Loading up the tutorial notebooks
Navigate to your checked out version of PlanOut and type:

```
ipython notebook --pylab inline
```
